The following packages must be installed prior to running this code:

- `ggplot2`
- `shiny`
- `tm`
- `RColorBrewer`
- `wordcloud`

To run this code, please enter the following commands in R:

```
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub('msan622', 'manoj-v', subdir='homework4')
```

This will start the `shiny` app. See below for details on how to interact with the visualization.

## Discussion ##

The dataset I chose to use was parts 1, 2, and 3 of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I found the pdfs of the books online and converted them to .txt format so the tm package in R will be able to munge them. I was interested in how often the characters were mentioned in the books, as well as how those mentions changed across the books. The first book was decidedly more focused on the hobbits, particularly Frodo, while the latter two books widened the focus to include Aragorn and the humans' struggle. The following charts were made in an effort to see if we could quantify that change of subject matter.

In order to munge the data, I used the tm package in R to remove stopwords, set the words to lowercase, and then remove some undesirable words that the stopwords list missed.

### Technique 1: Word Cloud

I created this plot using the worcloud package in R. I decided to color the plot because the color matches a frequency, and this makes it clearer the difference between the sizes of the words. The slider allows the user to input the number of words they want to include the in the cloud. Less words here makes it clearer which words are important.

### Technique 2: Bar Plot

This bar plot was generated by using ggplot2's geom_bar() function. I took the top 10 words for each text. Using the conditional input box for selecting which book the user wants to display changes which plot is shown. We can see that in the first book, Frodo is mentioned the most out of any character. No other word comes close in that book, or in any of the sequels. Changing the input to other books shows that the focus of the story was moved from Frodo to include the other main characters from the series.

### Technique 3: Word Tree

I created this phrase net to find the interconnectivity of different characters and words using IBM's Many Eyes website. In Tolkein's work, family lineage in very important to understanding a character. Tolkein regularly introduces characters in his work by speaking of the character's parents. Using the phrase selection box, the visualization can be set to look for instances of * son of *. This means for any instance of this phrase occurring, there will be an arrow pointing from the name occupying the first * to the name occupying the second *. We can clearly see that the phrase 'Aragorn son of Arathorn' is extremely common. Second to that is 'Frodo son of Drogo'. This makes complete sense considering the word frequencies we've seen already, as these are two major characters in the book. The link to this visualization is below:
